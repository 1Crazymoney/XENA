Base code for writing a modular bot client in python3.
Code is tested on Python version 3.9.2
In the env.py you can register modules to run, which are
a python scripts located at ./modules/*.py

There is a "HelloWorld" module which runs by typing into your terminal: python main.py

Or: python3 main.py
Depending on your environment.

I'm soon creating a code responsible for message exchange with Xena-Atila and Xena-Apep.
